I’m currently working on an Introduction to Web Development course that covers the basics of working with the command line, version control, git, markdown, HTML, CSS and CMS templating.

The course will be open sourced and freely available over on the [Codewheel GitHub](http://github.com/codewheel) account but to get the most out of it you should attend one of the courses I’ll be holding in the later half of 2017 in Melbourne, Australia.

If you’d like to be notified of when the courses will be held fill please [please get in touch](mailto:sam@margalit.com.au).
